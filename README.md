# Hospitality_Dashboard_Power_BI
## Project Objective
This project aims to analyze hotel bookings, occupancy, and revenue trends using Power BI.
The dashboard provides insights into KPIs like ADR, occupancy %, and booking patterns.
It helps stakeholders make data-driven decisions to improve performance in the hospitality sector.

## Questions (KPIs)
What is the total revenue generated across hotels and cities?

What is the Revenue per Available Room (RevPAR) over time?

How many Daily Sellable Room Nights (DSRN) are available?

What is the overall Occupancy % across hotels and room categories?

What is the Average Daily Rate (ADR) for bookings?

What is the Realisation % of bookings (confirmed vs. available)?

Which city, hotel, and room type generate the highest revenue?

How do weekday vs. weekend bookings impact KPIs?

Which booking platforms contribute to higher ADR and realisation %?

## Project Process
Collected data from CSV files (hotels, rooms, bookings, dates).
Cleaned and prepared the data for consistency and accuracy.
Built a star schema model with fact and dimension tables in Power BI.
Created KPIs and interactive visuals (cards, charts, slicers, tables).

##Final Conclusion

The Hospitality Analytics Dashboard successfully highlights key business metrics such as Revenue, Occupancy %, ADR, and Realisation %.
From the analysis, we observe that Mumbai and Bangalore are the top revenue contributors, while Elite and Premium rooms generate the highest income. 
Despite strong revenue performance, the average occupancy remains moderate at ~58%, suggesting potential to improve room utilization.
Overall, the dashboard enables stakeholders to monitor performance, identify revenue drivers, and make data-driven decisions to enhance profitability in the hospitality sector.
