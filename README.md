# Hospitality_Dashboard_Power_BI
## Project Objective
This project aims to analyze hotel bookings, occupancy, and revenue trends using Power BI.
The dashboard provides insights into KPIs like ADR, occupancy %, and booking patterns.
It helps stakeholders make data-driven decisions to improve performance in the hospitality sector.

## Questions (KPIs)
What is the total revenue generated across hotels and cities?
What is the Revenue per Available Room (RevPAR) over time?
How many Daily Sellable Room Nights (DSRN) are available?
What is the overall Occupancy % across hotels and room categories?
What is the Average Daily Rate (ADR) for bookings?
What is the Realisation % of bookings (confirmed vs. available)?
Which city, hotel, and room type generate the highest revenue?
How do weekday vs. weekend bookings impact KPIs?
Which booking platforms contribute to higher ADR and realisation %?

## Project Process
